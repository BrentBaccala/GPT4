Here is the code for the `do_nothing` function:

```
#include <flint/fmpz_mpoly.h>

void do_nothing(const fmpz_mpoly_vec_t input, fmpz_mpoly_vec_t output, const fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t ctx)
{
    // Do nothing
}
```

This function takes three arguments: an input vector of polynomial generators, an output vector of polynomials, and a ring context. It uses the FLINT library for polynomial operations.

The function simply does nothing and returns immediately. It takes in the input vector and the ring context, but it does not use them. The output vector is also not modified by the function. This function can be useful as a placeholder when testing code, or as a default function to use when no actual computation is needed.
