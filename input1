Never use fmpz_mpoly_init_set!

flint_printf does not take an initial FILE * argument.

Never use fmpz_mpoly_get_term_coeff_fmpz; it does not exist. Instead,
construct the i'th term in a polynomial by making
a copy of the polynomial, truncating it to keep only
the first i-1 terms, then subtracting the truncated polynomial from the
original polynomial, then constructing the leading term of that result.

Function reduce_by_matching_term returns void, and
   its first argument is an input/output polynomial to be reduced,
   its second argument is a matching term in that polynomial,
   its third argument is the polynomial to reduce with,
   and its fourth argument is the ring context.

Function reduce_by_matching_term logs the matching term, the polynomial to be reduced, and the polynomial to reduce with,
   then computes the GCD of the matching term and the leading term of the polynomial to reduce with
   multiplies the polynomial to reduce with by that GCD,
   and subtracts that result from the polynomial to be reduced.

Make sure the function logs three things when it starts.

Output the header, any required function declarations, the code for reduce_by_matching_term, and nothing else, without any explaination.
