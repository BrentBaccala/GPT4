Function reduce_by_vector takes these arguments: an input/output polynomial,
an immutable input vector of polynomials and an immutable ring context.

Function reduce_by_vector first logs its input/output polynomial,
then constructs the leading term of the input/output polynomial,
then loops over its input vector of polynomials, and for each polynomial in the vector,
constructs the leading term of the polynomial in the vector,
and checks the leading term of each polynomial in the vector to
see if it divides the leading term of the input/output polynomial.
If so, log that fact, then multiply that polynomial from the vector by the GCD
of its leading term and the leading term of the input/output polynomial,
then subtract that result from the input/output polynomial
and recompute the leading term of the input/output polynomial.

Keep doing this until either the result becomes zero, or no polynomial in the vector matches the condition above.

Log the result of the reduction before returning.

Make sure that reduce_by_vector prints those logging messages when it starts and before it returns.
