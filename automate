Write a Python 3 script, and output it without any commentary.

The script should use Selenium.

Use Firefox as the WebDriver.

Start by connecting to https://poe.com/, click on the "Continue" button in the "Sign in with Google" popup,

The "Continue" button will appear in the DOM as a button with id "continue", and will be in an iframe
with title "Sign in with Google Dialog".

Wait for a new window to appear titled "Sign in - Google Accounts".

Do it like this:

WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.number_of_windows_to_be(2))
signin_window = [window for window in driver.window_handles if window != driver.current_window_handle][0]
driver.switch_to.window(signin_window)

In that window's DOM there will be an input element with type attribute "email".

Enter my email address "cosine@freesoft.org" into that "Sign In" window, and click "Next".

Prompt the user on the script's stdin/stdout for a password, and wait for it to be entered.
Make sure not to echo the password while it's being typed.

There will be an input box on the web page with type "password" and name "Passwd".  Enter
the password in this box and click "Next".

Switch the browsing context back to the original window.

Wait for "Claude+" to appear in a HTML P element and click on it.

In the textarea with placeholder text that says "Talk to Claude+ on Poe", enter "count from 1 to 10" and push the send button.

The send button is an HTML button element containing a single svg element which itself contains a single path element.
Find the send button using XPATH that looks for a button containing an svg containing a path.
The svg element is in XML namespace "http://www.w3.org/2008/svg"

Wait ten seconds before exiting.

Be sure to include a shebang line at the beginning.
