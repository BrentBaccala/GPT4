Write a Python 3 script, and output it without any commentary.

The script should use Selenium.

The name of the chatbot is "ChatGPT".

The user query is "write a Python program that counts from 1 to 10"

Use Firefox as the WebDriver.

Start by connecting to https://poe.com/, click on the "Continue" button in the "Sign in with Google" popup,

Use EC.element_to_be_clickable whenever you want to find an element id, or CSS, or XPATH in the DOM.

You'll have to import By from selenium.webdriver.common.by, but By.TITLE does not exist.
Never attempt to use By.TITLE

The "Continue" button will appear in the DOM as a button with id "continue", and will be in an iframe
with title "Sign in with Google Dialog".
Use EC.frame_to_be_available_and_switch_to_it to find the iframe.

Wait for a new window to appear titled "Sign in - Google Accounts".

Do it like this:

WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.number_of_windows_to_be(2))
signin_window = [window for window in driver.window_handles if window != driver.current_window_handle][0]
driver.switch_to.window(signin_window)

In that window's DOM there will be an input element with type attribute "email".
Use EC.element_to_be_clickable to find it.

Enter my email address "cosine@freesoft.org" into that "Sign In" window, and click "Next".

Prompt the user on the script's stdin/stdout for a password, and wait for it to be entered.
Make sure not to echo the password while it's being typed.

There will be an input box on the web page with type "password" and name "Passwd".  Enter
the password in this box and click "Next".

The sign in window should disappear.  If doesn't disappear,
print "Bad password" on stdout and exit the script.

Otherwise, switch the browsing context back to the original window.

Wait for the name of the chatbot to appear in a HTML P element and click on it.

The entry box is the textarea with placeholder text that says "Talk to", followed by the name of the chatbot, then "on Poe".
Use EC.presence_of_element_located to find the entry box.

The entry box's parent is a div, and that div's parent is another div, the chat message input container.
The chat message input container has a child element that is a "button".  This is the send button.

Use this xpath to find the send button:
'//textarea[@placeholder="Talk to ChatBot on Poe"]/parent::div/parent::div/button',
but replace the string "ChatBot" with the name of the chatbot.
Use driver.find_element for this step, there is no driver.find_element_by_xpath.

Enter the user query in the entry box and push the send button.

Wait five seconds using time.sleep

The copy buttons are HTML buttons that contain an svg element and the text "Copy".

Use driver.find_elements to find the copy buttons.
Use '//button[contains(., "Copy")]' for the XPATH to match the copy button.
Find the last copy button in the DOM and click it.

Some text will appear in the clipboard.

Get the text in the clipboard and print it to stdout.
Use driver.execute_script to get the text.

Pause indefinitely, until the user hits CNTL-C, then exit.

Be sure to include a shebang line at the beginning.
