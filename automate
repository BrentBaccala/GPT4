The script should use Selenium.  Run the tests headed.

Use Firefox as the WebDriver.

Start by connecting to https://poe.com/, click on the "Continue" button in the "Sign in with Google" popup,

The "Continue" button will appear in the DOM as a button with id "continue", and will be in an iframe
with title "Sign in with Google Dialog".

Then a new window will appear titled "Sign in - Google Accounts".  In that window's DOM there
will be an input element with type attribute "email".

Enter my email address "cosine@freesoft.org" into that "Sign In" window, and click "Next".

Pause for ten seconds before exiting.

Be sure to include a shebang line at the beginning.
