Function fmpz_mpoly_leadterm
constructs the leading term of a polynomial "poly" and puts the answer in "res".

Copy "poly" to "res".
Do not initialize "res" before copying into it.

Check next to see if the length of the polynomial is greater than 1.  If so, truncate "res" to length 1.

Output the code for fmpz_mpoly_leadterm, and nothing else except the header, without any explaination.
