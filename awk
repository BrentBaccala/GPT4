My work log contains some lines that start will billable hours.
All such lines start with optional whitespace, then a decimal number of hours, then the word 'hr'.
Write an awk script that adds up all billable hours in my work log.
Make sure you add the entire numbers, with the decimal parts.
Make sure it starts with a shebang command.
