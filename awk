My work log contains some lines that start will billable hours.
All such lines start with optional whitespace, then a decimal number of hours, then the word 'hr'.
Write an awk script that adds up all billable hours in my work log.
That decimal number of hours you matched is the number to be added.
Make sure the script starts with a shebang command.
