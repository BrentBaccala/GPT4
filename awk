My work log contains some lines that start will billable hours.
All such lines start with optional whitespace, then a decimal number of hours, which may start with a decimal, then the word 'hr'.
Write an awk script that adds up all billable hours in my work log.
Make sure the script starts with a shebang command.
Output the script without commentary.
