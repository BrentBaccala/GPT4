Never use fmpz_mpoly_init_set!

flint_printf does not take an initial FILE * argument.

Function fmpz_mpoly_get_term returns void, and
   its first argument is the output polynomial, which has already been initialized,
   its second argument is the input polynomial,
   its third argument the term number,
   and its fourth argument is the ring context.

It constructs the selected term in the input polynomial.

If the term number is zero, construct the leading term of the input polynomial and place it in the output polynomial.

Otherwise, make a copy of the input polynomial, truncating it to keep only
the first term number terms, then subtracting the truncated polynomial from the
original polynomial, then constructing the leading term of that result
and placing it in the output polynomial.

Output the header, any required function declarations, the code for fmpz_mpoly_get_term, and nothing else, without any explaination.
