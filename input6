There is no function fmpz_mpoly_vec_swap_entry.
To swap a polynomial with a polynomial in a vector, do it like this:
    fmpz_mpoly_swap(poly, fmpz_mpoly_vec_entry(vec, i), ctx);

Never call fmpz_mpoly_vec_swap_entry!  It does not exist.

You should only call fmpz_mpoly_vec_init once on any given polynomial vector.

There is no function fmpz_mpoly_vec_remove_index, do not attempt to use it.

You can not remove a polynomial from an existing polynomial vector.
Instead, you must make a new polynomial vector and append all of the polynomials
from the original polynomial vector, except the one you want to remove.

Function buchberger_reduced returns void, and
   its first argument is the output polynomial vector,
   its second argument is the input polynomial vector of generators,
   and its third argument is the ring context.

Function buchberger_reduced first calls buchberger_naive with the input generators
to construct a naive Groebner basis.
Then it loops over all of the polynomials in the basis.
For each one, it constructs the polynomial vector of all the other polynomials in the basis
reduces the selected polynomial by the polynomial vector composed of all the other polynomials,
and replaces the polynomial in the basis vector by its reduction.
The output polynomial vector is all non-zero polynomials in the basis vector.

The reductions in this function never use lead reduction.

Output the header, the assumed function declarations, then the code for buchberger_reduced, without any explanation.
