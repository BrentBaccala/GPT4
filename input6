There is no function fmpz_mpoly_vec_swap_entry.
To swap a polynomial with a polynomial in a vector, do it like this:
    fmpz_mpoly_swap(poly, fmpz_mpoly_vec_entry(vec, i), ctx);

void buchberger_reduced(fmpz_mpoly_vec_t res, const fmpz_mpoly_vec_t gens, const fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t ctx)

Function buchberger_reduced first calls buchberger_naive to construct a non-reduced Groebner basis.
Then it loops over all of the polynomials in the result, reducing each one by the vector
composed of all of the other polynomials in the result.  Any polynomial that reduces to zero
is removed from the result.  Any polynomial that changes as a result of the reduction
is replaced by its reduction.

Output the code for buchberger_reduced, and nothing else except the header, without any explaination.
