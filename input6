There is no function fmpz_mpoly_vec_swap_entry.
To swap a polynomial with a polynomial in a vector, do it like this:
    fmpz_mpoly_swap(poly, fmpz_mpoly_vec_entry(vec, i), ctx);

Never call fmpz_mpoly_vec_swap_entry!  It does not exist.

You can not remove a polynomial from an existing polynomial vector.
Instead, you must make a new polynomial vector and append all of the polynomials
from the original polynomial vector, except the one you want to remove.

Function buchberger_reduced returns void, and
   its first argument is the output polynomial vector,
   its second argument is the input polynomial vector of generators,
   and its third argument is the ring context.

Function buchberger_reduced first calls buchberger_naive with the input generators
to construct a naive Groebner basis.
Then it loops over all of the polynomials in the basis.
For each one, it constructs the polynomial vector of all the other polynomials in the basis
and reduces the selected polynomial by the polynomial vector composed of all the other polynomials.
Any polynomial that reduces to zero
is removed from the basis.  Any polynomial that changes as a result of the reduction
is replaced in the basis by its reduction.

Output the header, the assumed function declarations, then the code for buchberger_reduced, without any explanation.
