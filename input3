Function buchberger_naive takes these arguments:
   - an mutable output vector of polynomials
   - an immutable vector of generators
   - an immutable ring context

Function buchberger_naive maintains two local vectors of polynomials,
called the basis and the s-pairs.  Start by copying the vector
of generators to the basis.  For each pair of generators,
construct their s-pair and insert it into the s-pairs if it
is unique.  Then work through the vector of s-pairs from
beginning to end, reducing each one by the basis.
If the result is not zero, then append the result to
the basis, and loop over all of the other basis polynomials,
constructing the s-pair of it and the new basis polynomial,
and appending it to the s-pairs if it is unique.  Make sure
to process all of the s-pairs, even the ones added during
processing.

Function buchberger_naive puts the basis in the output vector
once the loop has terminated, and returns void.
