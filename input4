A test case is a vector of polynomials

Test case 1 is (2x+3y+4z-5, 3x+4y+5z-2)

Run test case 1 by constructing a ring context for a polynomial ring
over the rational numbers with three variables (x,y,z), and
degrevlex order, then calling buchberger_naive with test case 1
and the ring context, and then printing the returned basis.

Test case 2 is just like test case 1, except you call buchberger_reduced instead of buchberger_naive.

Function main runs test case 1, then test case 2.

Output the code for the test cases and main, and nothing else except the header, without any explanation.
