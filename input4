include(common)

A test case is a vector of polynomials

Test case 1 is (2x+3y+4z-5, 3x+4y+5z-2)

Run test case 1 by constructing a ring context for a polynomial ring
over the rational numbers with three variables (x,y,z), and
degrevlex order, then calling buchberger_naive with test case 1
and the ring context, and then printing the returned basis.

Test case 2 is just like test case 1, except you call buchberger_reduced instead of buchberger_naive.

Function main runs test case 1, then test case 2.

Output first the header with the include files, then any required function declarations,
then the code for the function main, and test cases, and no other functions, and nothing else, without any explaination.
