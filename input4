A test case is a vector of polynomials

Test case 1 is (2x+3y+4z-5, 3x+4y+5z-2)

Function test_case_1 constructs a ring context for a polynomial ring
over the rational numbers with three variables (x,y,z), and
degrevlex order, then calls buchberger_naive with test case 1
and the ring context, and prints the returned basis.

Function main just calls test_case_1.

Output the code for test_case_1 and main, and nothing else except the header, without any explaination.
