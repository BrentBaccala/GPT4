Write a C function called compute_groebner_basis to compute a Groebner basis.

Use the FLINT library for the polynomial operations, as documented in https://flintlib.org/doc/

Use fmpz_mpoly_t for the polynomials.

compute_groebner basis takes one arguments: an array of polynomials, each of type fmpz_mpoly_t

Just output the code without any explaination.
