Never use fmpz_mpoly_init_set!

Never assign the result of fmpz_mpoly_vec_entry to a variable!

flint_printf does not take an initial FILE * argument.

fmpz_mpoly_divides sets its first argument to the quotient of
its second argument divided by its third one, if the division
is exact, and return TRUE.  If the division is not exact, the
first argument is not modified and the function returns FALSE.
To test for divisibility, use a dummy polynomial for the first
argument.

Never use fmpz_mpoly_get_term_coeff_fmpz; it does not exist. Instead,
construct the i'th term in a polynomial by making
a copy of the polynomial, truncating it to keep only
the first i-1 terms, then subtracting the truncated polynomial from the
original polynomial, then constructing the leading term of that result.

Function fmpz_mpoly_is_divisible returns a boolean, and
   its first argument is the dividend,
   its second argument is the divisor,
   and its third argument is the ring context.

Function fmpz_mpoly_is_divisible creates a dummy polynomial
to use for the first argument to fmpz_mpoly_divides, and uses that
function to test for divisibility.  Return the same result,
after clearing the dummy polynomial.

Output the header, any required function declarations, the code for fmpz_mpoly_is_divisible, and nothing else, without any explaination.
