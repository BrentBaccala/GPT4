You can use the following awk script to add up all the billable hours in your work log:

```awk
BEGIN {
    total_billable_hours = 0
}
/^[[:space:]]*[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?[[:space:]]+hr/ {
    hours = $1
    total_billable_hours += hours
}
END {
    printf "Total billable hours: %.2f\n", total_billable_hours
}
```

Save this script as `billable_hours.awk` and run it using the following command:

```bash
awk -f billable_hours.awk work_log.txt
```

The script will search for lines starting with optional whitespace, followed by a decimal number, whitespace, and the word 'hr'. It will then extract the number of hours and add them up. Finally, it will print the total billable hours at the end.
