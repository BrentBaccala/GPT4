Write a C function called construct_s_pairs to compute a Groebner basis.

Use the FLINT library for the polynomial operations, as documented in https://flintlib.org/doc/

Use types fmpz_mpoly_t for the polynomials,
fmpz_mpoly_vec_t for a vector of polynomials, and
fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t for a ring context.

construct_s_pairs takes these arguments: an immutable input vector of polynomial generators,
an immutable output vector of s-pairs, and an immutable ring context.

construct_s_pairs loops over every pair of polynomial generators, and for each one,
  constructs the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their leading terms,
  multiplies a copy of each generator by the leading term of the other generator,
  divides that copy by the GCD,
  then subtracts those two copies from each other,
  and appends that result to the output vector.

Just output the code without any explaination.
