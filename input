Write a C function called construct_s_pairs to compute a Groebner basis.

Use the FLINT library for the polynomial operations, as documented in https://flintlib.org/doc/

Use types fmpz_mpoly_t for the polynomials,
fmpz_mpoly_vec_t for a vector of polynomials, and
fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t for a ring context.

construct_s_pairs takes these arguments: an immutable input vector of polynomial generators,
an immutable output vector of s-pairs, and an immutable ring context.

construct_s_pairs loops over every pair of polynomial generators, multiplies them together,
and returns all of those products in the output vector.

Just output the code without any explaination.
