Write a C function called do_nothing to compute a Groebner basis.

Use the FLINT library for the polynomial operations, as documented in https://flintlib.org/doc/

Use types fmpz_mpoly_t for the polynomials,
fmpz_mpoly_vec_t for a vector of polynomials, and
fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t for a ring context.

do_nothing takes these arguments: an immutable input vector of polynomial generators,
an immutable output vector of polynomials, and an immutable ring context.

do_nothing should do nothing.

Just output the code without any explaination.
