Write a C function called compute_groebner_basis to compute a Groebner basis.

Use the FLINT library for the polynomial operations, as documented in https://flintlib.org/doc/

Use types fmpz_mpoly_t for the polynomials,
fmpz_mpoly_vec_t for a vector of polynomials, and
fmpz_mpoly_ctx_t for a ring context.

compute_groebner_basis takes these arguments: an immutable input vector of polynomial generators,
an immutable output vector of polynomials, and an immutable ring context.

compute_groebner_basis uses Buchberger's algorithm to construct a Groebner basis of the ideal
generated by the input vector and stores the Groebner basis in the output vector.

Just output the code without any explaination.
