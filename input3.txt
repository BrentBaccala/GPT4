Function buchberger_naive maintains two local vectors of polynomials,
called the basis and the s-pairs.  Start by copying the vector
of generators to the basis.  For each pair of generators,
construct their s-pair and insert it into the s-pairs if it
is unique.  Then work through the vector of s-pairs from
beginning to end, reducing each one by the basis.
Use reduce_by_vector with lead reduction enabled.
If the result is not zero, then append the result to
the basis, and loop over all of the other basis polynomials,
constructing the s-pair of it and the new basis polynomial,
and appending it to the s-pairs if it is unique.  Make sure
to process all of the s-pairs, even the ones added during
processing.

Function buchberger_naive puts the basis in the output vector
once the loop has terminated, and returns void.

You can not add items to a polynomial vector by calling fmpz_mpoly_set
with an fmpz_mpoly_vec_entry as your destination; you have to use fmpz_mpoly_vec_append.

Output the header, any required function declarations, the code for buchberger_naive, and nothing else, without any explaination.

Output no function defintions except the code for buchberger_naive.
